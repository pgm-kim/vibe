We offer a solution
For our climate
Listening to the science
The consequences of climate change are mounting by the day, and we all must work to be a part of the solution. As a streaming service, our impact on the climate isn’t always obvious. We exist in the digital space, but ultimately, our business is grounded in the physical world, in our office spaces, our suppliers’ data centers, and our listeners’ devices.

We can’t save the world by playing by the rules, because the rules have to be changed. Everything needs to change and it has to start today.
— Greta Thunberg, TEDxStockholm on November 24, 2018
